**These are my personal solutions to Codewars katas. This repository helps me keep them organized and also encourages me to code daily and improve as a developer. 
Please do not use these codes to cheat on the platform.**

- Please do not view my solutions to a kata until you have completed it yourself, or at least taken the time to think about your own approach.

- Please do not submit my solutions as your own.

- Please note that I will not be accepting any form of contributions to this repository.
