## INSTRUCTIONS

Write a query to produce a result set that lists an array of student names (ordered by their student_id in ascending order) for each subject where these students achieved the highest mark for that subject. Your result should also include the subject name and the highest mark achieved.

### Table Schema:

### students:

- student_id (integer) - Unique identifier for each student.
- student_name (varchar) - Name of the student.
- details (varchar) - Additional details related to the student (for this challenge, it may have a static value like 'X').

### subjects:

- subject_id  (varchar) - Unique identifier for each subject (e.g., 'M' for Math).
- subject_name (varchar) - Name of the subject (e.g., 'Math', 'English').

### marks:

- student_id (integer) - Identifier linking to the students table.
- subject_id (varchar) - Identifier linking to the subjects table.
- mark_rate (integer) - The mark or score the student has received for the subject.

### Resultant Dataset Columns:

- student_names (varchar[]) - Array of student names who scored the top mark for a subject, ordered by their student ID in ascending order.
- subject_name (varchar) - Name of the subject.
- mark_rate (integer) - The highest mark achieved in the subject.

The result set should be ordered by the subject_id in ascending order.

GLHF!
