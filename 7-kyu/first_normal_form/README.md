## INSTRUCTIONS

This Kata is a short introduction to the topic of database normalization. 
It's just a simple example of a decently complex topic with some details omitted for simplicity; to all interested, I advise further study.

### Background
Normalization is a process of removing data redundancy from the database. 
Reduction of duplicated data means a lesser probability of inconsistencies and greater flexibility. 
Normal Forms are steps between which different forms of data redundancy are removed from the table. 
For a higher normal form to be satisfied all lower normal forms must also be satisfied.

### First Normal Form (1NF)
To achieve First Normal Form (1NF) every column in the table must be atomic i.e. it can't contain a collection of values.

### Task

You will be provided with a single table restaurants from which you have to extract two tables conforming to the First Normal Form

1. The first table must contain restaurants without a column with collection of values - menu field should be removed.
2. The second table must contain a dish column and a restaurant_id column - matching dishes to their restaurants

- Ordering is not important
- The solution should leave the database with two tables (restaurants and dishes) which will be queried by the tests.

|             | menu   | string | comma-separated list of unique dishes (dish name may contain spaces) |
|             | name   | string |                                                                      |
